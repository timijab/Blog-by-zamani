        <p> Hi to the lovely person reading this, it is so pleasant to meet you, My name is Jane , and I am a freelance Data analyst and a lady who loves to manage people and projects.</p>
        <p> I am very passionate to see people in a better mental head space and enjoy the life that abba has blessed them with, </p>
        <p> While I am not doing my data analyst duties, I always fill my spirit man with lovely messages of men of God I respect and one of them is Apostle Joshua Selman.</p>
        <p> You will be seeing written sermon notes written by Apostle Joshua Selman that will richly bless your soul if only you believe and engage with the instructions in obedience. </p>
        <p> Finally, this is my scripture for you and my wish for you <em> 3John 1:2 </em> I wish that thou mayest prosper and be in good health even as your soul prospereth And this is what I am trying to achieve with this blog.</p>
        <p> We are all on this journey together and we all  will flourish both spiritually, in our finances and in our bodies In Jesus Name.</p>
